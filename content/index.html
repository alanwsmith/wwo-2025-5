  <summary>The Code</summary>
  <p>
    This is the code that makes the page happen. 
    The project is itself a remix of <a href="https://splitter.fm/">splitter.fm</a>
    which is an awesome little tool for doing your own mixes
    of songs from a bunch of bands. It only lets you 
    mute and solo tracks though. I wanted to see
    what it was like with full faders.

  <p>You can't click around to different parts
    of the song in this version. I'll
    add that in in the next version</p>
